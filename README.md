# High-Level Template of the Project
I have created this template for the first part of my thesis project, which will be used with L1 Italian speakers. The text presented in its current form is created using the pipeline I have built before. For the sake of easier adjustments, this text is hard-coded into the web app so that there will be no need to regenerate the text each time the page is refreshed.

## Things I Have Implemented
Currently, I have implemented the following questions:

- What was the topic of the text?
- On a scale of 1-5, how enjoyable was this text?
- How would you describe the Italian level of this text?
- Do you think this text was written by a robot or a human?
- From the following options, what was the tone of the text?
### Functional Adequacy Implementation
I have also implemented elements of the Functional Adequacy scale with this version, which can be seen on the web app.

### Submit and Data Collection
After all of the questions are answered, the user will press the "Submit Answers" button. As you can see on the app, a dictionary of the gathered data and a pandas dataframe will be automatically created by the app. These can be downloaded as a CSV as well.
